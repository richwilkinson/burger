# Issues
    I ran into issues with linking the front end to the back and making all my routes work as required. I was able to get the info already in the database to show, however i could not get new info to render or button function to work properly. If you add a burger you can see the url being structured but I could not get them to render or redirect.
### Instructions
    In theory, you would run the sight and add a burger of your choice, then you could press the button to devour it and it will go into the devour section, all burgers would be shown in their appropriate sections of devoured or not. once all burgers are rendered then you can choose to delete any burgers not up to snuff.
